## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?

Victoria Reyes Borges - For the smaller piles, the algorithms seemed to go finished quickly but when there were bigger piles, they got slower. Selection adn insertion sort were slower (O(n^2)), while Quicksort and merge sort were faster (O(n log n)).

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

Victoria Reyes Borges - I enjoyed this aissgnment, mostlye because I like the concepts of the sorting algorithms and the different ways we can use them. I found challeging visually the algortihms mentally or without any physcial objects, so I had to use some of my personal things to figure out the logic! I found interesting how, in a way, we can "make" storage in coding but when we perform these sorting algortihms that storage is just space "in real life", so definitely tying that back what I was doing with physically visualizing my algorithm into code was interesting!
